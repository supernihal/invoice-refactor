- created: When an invoice is created.
- rejected: When a submitted invoice is rejected for some reason.
- approved: When an invoice is approved and it is available to be purchased.
- purchased: When an invoice is purchased by the lender.
- closed: When an invoice is closed, it is in the last state of its life cycle.


**Invoices:**
- Invoice # - alphanumeric (cannot be repeated in the system)
- Invoice amount
- Invoice due date
- Status

**Borrowers:**
- Name

**Acceptance Criteria**
- A way to handle invoice statuses
	- Only approved invoices can be purchased
	- Only purchased invoices can be closed
		
**What will be evaluated:**

* Tests - Frontend/integration tests are preferable
* Documentation â†’ need to be able to run locally without asking
* Version control organization (meaningful commits)

This challenge should take around 2hs.
